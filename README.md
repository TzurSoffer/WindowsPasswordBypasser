## About:
A badUSB script that gains full admin access to a windows machine from the login screen.

## Note for pico-ducky
Must use [my fork](https://github.com/TzurSoffer/pico-ducky/tree/main) of the pico-ducky as it supports holding and releasing keys.

### How it works:
1. It reboots into safe mode
2. It opens a cmd from safe mode
3. It changes the Utilman.exe to be a cmd.exe
4. It boots back into windows
5. It opens the help menu which has been replaced with a cmd instance
6. It creates a new admin account named ```rubberDucky``` with the password ```1234```
7. It logs into the new account
